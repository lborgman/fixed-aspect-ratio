# fixed-aspect-ratio

This is a test of aspect-ratio for element with position: fixed, CSS:

```CSS
aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
max-height: 60vh;
max-width: 60vw;
position: fixed;".
```

Aspect ratio is not maintained for the axis with the biggest of screen width/height.
You can [test it here](https://lborgman.github.io/fixed-aspect-ratio/fixed-aspect-ratio.html).
